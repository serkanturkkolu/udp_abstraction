# udp_abstraction
Udp for Linux , MacOs , Windows

<b>Build for MacOs or Linux ;</b>

sh posix_build.sh

So you got server and client files in main directory. You can run these files and test it!

<b>Build for Windows ;</b>

You can add main.cpp in win/server or win/client to your windows project and you must add src/udp.cpp , include/iudp.h and /include/udp.h to your project. So you can use MSVC after they are done.

If you will use Mingw , you install Mingw-w64 with posix thread , i686 , dwarf (recommended ver 8.1.0) .
